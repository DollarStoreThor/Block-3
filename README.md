UNIT #3 : Applied Data Science with Python

Block14: NumPy
Overview
As a data analyst at Weather Insights, a leading weather analytics company, you have been assigned the crucial task of analyzing and extracting insights from a dataset containing daily weather records. Your goal is to process the weather data using NumPy and derive meaningful conclusions that will help meteorologists and decision-makers understand patterns, fluctuations, and critical weather events. 

Scenario
Weather Insights has collected historical weather data for a specific location over the past week. The dataset, stored as a NumPy array, includes information about the date, temperature, humidity, and precipitation for each day. The management has tasked you with performing a comprehensive analysis to provide key insights. 

Dataset
The weather data is represented as a NumPy array with the following structure: 

#Data in array format [date, temperature, humidity, precipitation] 

weather_data = np.array([ 

    ["2023-07-01", 30, 60, 0.1], 

    ["2023-07-02", 31, 62, 0.2], 

    ["2023-07-03", 29, 65, 0.0], 

    ["2023-07-04", 33, 68, 0.5], 

    ["2023-07-05", 34, 70, 0.3], 

    ["2023-07-06", 32, 63, 0.1], 

    ["2023-07-07", 30, 61, 0.0] 

 ]) 
Directions
Perform the following analyses using NumPy and present your findings to the senior meteorologists at Weather Insights: 

Calculate the average temperature for the entire dataset to provide an overall understanding of the weather conditions.Identify the hottest day during the week. Compute the temperature fluctuations over time to analyze the variability in daily temperatures. This fluctuation is calculated by providing the difference in temperature between the current day and the previous day. Note that you will begin tracking temperature fluctuations starting from the second day (since we have nothing to compare for day 1).
Identify days with high precipitation (precipitation above 0.2 inches) to highlight weather events with significant rainfall. 
Calculate the average humidity for days with high precipitation to understand humidity levels during rainy periods. 
Calculate the total precipitation for the entire dataset to quantify the overall rainfall experienced during the week. 
Identify the coldest day during the week. 
Filter data for summer days (temperature above 30 degrees Celsius) to analyze specific hot weather patterns. 
Calculate the average temperature for summer days to provide insights into the temperature during the summer period. 
Count the number of days with no precipitation to understand the frequency of dry days. 
Prepare a comprehensive report with your analysis, insights, and visualizations to assist meteorologists in making informed decisions and understanding the weather trends in the specified location.
